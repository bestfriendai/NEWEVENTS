## ðŸš€ Implementation Summary

All production improvements have been successfully implemented! Here's what was accomplished:

### âœ… Code Cleanup & Debugging
- **Removed Mock Data**: Replaced MockUserRepository and other mock services with real Supabase implementations
- **Structured Logging**: Replaced all console.log statements with proper logging using the logger service
- **Debug Routes Cleanup**: Removed debug API routes and development-only code
- **Production-Ready User Actions**: Updated user-actions.ts to use real database operations

### âœ… Error Handling & Boundaries
- **React Error Boundaries**: Created comprehensive error boundary components with fallback UI
- **Global Error Handling**: Implemented global error handlers for uncaught errors and promise rejections
- **Error Reporting**: Added structured error logging with context and metadata
- **User-Friendly UI**: Created beautiful error screens with retry and navigation options

### âœ… Enhanced Image Processing
- **Image Validation Service**: Built robust image validation with accessibility checks
- **Caching Strategy**: Implemented intelligent image caching with TTL
- **Fallback System**: Created category-based fallback images for failed loads
- **Loading States**: Added proper loading states for image validation

### âœ… API Rate Limiting & Optimization
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Implemented circuit breakers to prevent cascade failures
- **Intelligent Retry Logic**: Added exponential backoff and smart retry mechanisms
- **Rate Limit Respect**: Built rate limiting that respects API headers and limits
- **Request Queuing**: Created priority-based request queuing system

### âœ… Event Deduplication Logic
- **Similarity Detection**: Advanced multi-field similarity comparison using Levenshtein distance
- **Quality-Based Selection**: Smart selection of best events from duplicate groups
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient algorithms for large event datasets
- **Comprehensive Scoring**: Event quality scoring based on multiple factors
