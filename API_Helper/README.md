# NEWEVENTS API Documentation (`API_Helper`)

## Introduction

The NEWEVENTS project relies on various external APIs to deliver its rich feature set, including event discovery, mapping, and user-specific functionalities. This `API_Helper` directory serves as the centralized hub for all API-related documentation, integration guides, and best practices. Its purpose is to ensure that developers have a clear, consistent, and accessible resource for understanding and working with these critical external services.

## Documentation Strategy

Our API documentation strategy is guided by the following philosophy and goals:

*   **Philosophy:** To provide documentation that is clear, concise, consistent, and actionable.
*   **Goals:**
    *   Facilitate smooth and efficient integration of third-party APIs.
    *   Ensure the maintainability and scalability of our API client implementations.
    *   Promote best practices in API usage, covering security, error handling, and performance optimization.
    *   Reduce the onboarding time for new developers joining the project.
    *   Serve as a reliable single source of truth for API integration details.

## Directory Structure

The `API_Helper` directory is organized as follows:

*   **`API_Helper/` (Root):**
    *   This `README.md` file, providing an overview of the API documentation.
    *   Potentially other general API-related documents or plans (e.g., `foundational_docs_creation_plan.md`).
*   **`API_Helper/shared/`:**
    *   Contains foundational documents that apply across multiple API integrations. These guides establish common patterns and best practices.
    *   Examples: `unified-api-architecture.md`, `error-handling-patterns.md`, `api-key-management.md`.
*   **`API_Helper/<api_name>/`:**
    *   Each subdirectory is dedicated to a specific third-party API (e.g., `API_Helper/mapbox/`, `API_Helper/supabase/`).
    *   These directories contain specific implementation guides, endpoint details, request/response examples, and any unique considerations for that particular API.

## How to Use This Documentation

*   **For understanding the overall API strategy and shared best practices:**
    *   Start with this `README.md`.
    *   Refer to the documents within the `API_Helper/shared/` directory for architectural guidelines, error handling patterns, and security practices.
*   **For integrating or working with a specific API:**
    *   Navigate to the respective `API_Helper/<api_name>/` directory.
    *   Consult the `implementation-guide.md` (or similarly named primary document) within that directory.

## Contributing to API Documentation

Maintaining high-quality API documentation is a collaborative effort. Please adhere to the following when contributing:

*   **Guidelines for Adding New API Documentation:**
    *   When integrating a new API, create a new subdirectory `API_Helper/<api_name>/`.
    *   Include an `implementation-guide.md` detailing setup, authentication, key endpoints, data models, and example usage.
    *   If the API introduces patterns not covered in `shared/` documents, consider proposing an update or addition to the relevant shared guide.
*   **Process for Updating Existing Documentation:**
    *   If you modify an API client or discover discrepancies, update the corresponding documentation promptly.
    *   Ensure changes are reviewed if they impact shared patterns or architectural decisions.
*   **Style Guide:**
    *   Follow general project markdown styling and code formatting conventions.
    *   Aim for clarity and conciseness. Use diagrams, code snippets, and examples where helpful.
*   **Importance of Up-to-Date Documentation:**
    *   Outdated documentation can be more misleading than no documentation. Strive to keep all API information current with the codebase.

## Key Foundational Documents

For a comprehensive understanding of our API integration approach, please refer to these essential shared documents:

*   [`shared/unified-api-architecture.md`](shared/unified-api-architecture.md)
*   [`shared/error-handling-patterns.md`](shared/error-handling-patterns.md)
*   [`shared/api-key-management.md`](shared/api-key-management.md) (Covers secure handling of API keys and secrets)
