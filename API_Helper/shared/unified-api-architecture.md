# Unified API Architecture for NEWEVENTS

## Introduction

Integrating multiple third-party APIs presents challenges in maintaining consistency, managing complexity, and ensuring scalability. A unified API architecture provides a standardized approach to address these challenges within the NEWEVENTS project.

*   **Importance:** A consistent architecture simplifies development, reduces redundancy, and makes the system more resilient to changes in external APIs.
*   **Goals:**
    *   **Consistency:** Ensure all API integrations follow similar patterns.
    *   **Reusability:** Promote the use of common components and utilities for API interactions.
    *   **Simplified Maintenance:** Make it easier to update, debug, and extend API integrations.
    *   **Improved Testability:** Facilitate the creation of robust unit and integration tests for API clients.
    *   **Scalability:** Allow for the addition of new API integrations with minimal friction.

## Core Architectural Principles

Our unified API architecture is built upon the following core principles:

*   **Abstraction:** Decouple the core application logic from the specific implementation details of individual API clients. This is typically achieved by defining clear interfaces or service contracts that API clients must adhere to.
*   **Modularity:** Each third-party API integration should be developed as a self-contained module or service. This promotes separation of concerns and makes it easier to manage individual integrations.
*   **Configuration-Driven:** API keys, base URLs, version numbers, and other API-specific settings should be externalized and managed through configuration (e.g., environment variables, configuration files) rather than being hardcoded.

## Standardized Request/Response Handling

To ensure consistency in how we interact with external APIs:

*   **Common Request Building:**
    *   Utilize a shared utility or helper class for constructing HTTP requests.
    *   Standardize how common headers (e.g., `Content-Type`, `Accept`, `Authorization`) are added.
    *   Implement a consistent mechanism for handling API authentication (e.g., Bearer tokens, API keys in headers/query params).
*   **Generic Response Parsing and Validation:**
    *   Develop a common approach for parsing responses (e.g., JSON, XML).
    *   Implement basic validation for response status codes and expected data structures.
    *   Handle common HTTP status codes (2xx, 4xx, 5xx) in a predictable manner.
*   **Consistent Data Structures:**
    *   Define standardized internal data models (e.g., for an "Event", "Venue") that API responses are transformed into. This shields the application from the diverse and often changing schemas of external APIs.

## Data Transformation Layers

A crucial component of the unified architecture is the data transformation layer.

*   **Purpose:** To map data from the varied structures of external API responses into the NEWEVENTS project's internal, standardized data models.
*   **Strategies:**
    *   Implement dedicated mapper functions or classes for each API integration.
    *   These mappers are responsible for extracting relevant fields, renaming attributes, and restructuring data as needed.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Isolates the main application logic from the specifics of external API schemas.
    *   Simplifies the process of switching API providers or adapting to API version changes, as only the transformation layer needs to be updated.

## Client-Side vs. Server-Side API Calls

The decision of whether to make an API call from the client-side (browser) or server-side involves several considerations:

*   **Criteria for Decision:**
    *   **Security:** Sensitive API keys or operations involving private data should always be handled server-side.
    *   **Rate Limits:** Server-side calls can help manage and aggregate API requests, potentially mitigating rate limit issues.
    *   **Data Sensitivity:** If the API response contains sensitive information not intended for the end-user, process it server-side.
    *   **User Experience:** For non-critical data or UI enhancements, client-side calls might offer better perceived performance.
    *   **CORS:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policies of the API provider can restrict client-side calls.
*   **Best Practices for Server-Side Calls:**
    *   Create dedicated API routes or services within the NEWEVENTS backend (e.g., Next.js API routes).
    *   Secure these endpoints appropriately.
*   **Considerations for Client-Side Calls:**
    *   Ensure API keys are not exposed if they are meant to be secret. Use "publishable" keys if available and appropriate.
    *   Be mindful of exposing too much information about backend infrastructure.
*   **Hybrid Approaches:**
    *   A common pattern is for the client to request data from a NEWEVENTS backend endpoint, which then makes the necessary calls to third-party APIs.

## Caching Strategies for API Responses

Effective caching can significantly improve performance and reduce the number of calls to external APIs.

*   **Identifying Cacheable Endpoints:** Determine which API responses are relatively static or can tolerate some staleness.
*   **Cache Duration (TTL - Time To Live):** Define appropriate cache durations based on how frequently the data changes.
*   **Invalidation Strategies:** Implement mechanisms to invalidate or refresh the cache when underlying data changes or when a forced refresh is needed.
*   **Recommended Caching Mechanisms:**
    *   **Server-Side Cache:** Use libraries like `node-cache` or Redis for caching data at the backend. Next.js offers built-in data caching capabilities.
    *   **Client-Side Cache:** Leverage browser caching (e.g., `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, HTTP cache headers) or state management libraries (e.g., React Query, SWR) for client-side caching.
    *   **CDN (Content Delivery Network):** For publicly accessible and frequently requested static API data, a CDN can be beneficial.
*   **Impact:** Caching reduces latency, decreases load on external APIs, and can help stay within rate limits.

## API Client Implementation Guidelines

When building a client module for a specific API:

*   **Structure:**
    *   Organize the client as a service class or a collection of well-defined functions.
    *   Group related API calls (e.g., user-related endpoints, event-related endpoints).
*   **Environment Variables:**
    *   Strictly use environment variables for API keys, base URLs, and other sensitive or environment-specific configurations. Refer to the `API_Helper/shared/api-key-management.md` guide.
*   **Logging:**
    *   Implement consistent logging for requests, responses (potentially summarized), and errors within the API client. This is crucial for debugging.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Write unit tests for data transformation logic and utility functions.
    *   Implement integration tests to verify the interaction with the actual API (can be mocked/stubbed in CI environments).

## Versioning

*   **External API Versions:** Be aware of the versioning scheme of the third-party API. Implement strategies to handle different API versions if the provider supports them (e.g., via URL path, headers).
*   **Internal API Client Versions:** If significant changes are made to an internal API client module, consider versioning it or clearly documenting breaking changes.

       |  +--> Request Construction (using shared utilities)
       |  +--> API Call Execution
       |  +--> Response Reception
       |
       v
