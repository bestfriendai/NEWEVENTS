# API Error Handling Patterns for NEWEVENTS

## Introduction

Interacting with third-party APIs inevitably involves encountering errors. A robust and consistent approach to error handling is crucial for building a resilient and user-friendly application. This document outlines standardized patterns for handling errors from various APIs within the NEWEVENTS project.

*   **The Inevitability of API Errors:** Network issues, API provider downtime, invalid requests, rate limits, and other problems can lead to API errors.
*   **Goals of Standardized Error Handling:**
    *   **Consistent Error Classification:** Uniformly categorize errors from different APIs.
    *   **Effective Logging:** Capture sufficient information for debugging and monitoring.
    *   **Graceful Degradation:** Allow the application to handle failures gracefully, minimizing user impact.
    *   **Informative User Feedback:** Provide clear and helpful messages to users when errors occur.
    *   **Improved Maintainability:** Simplify the process of managing and updating error handling logic.

## Common API Error Types

While specific error responses vary between APIs, many fall into common categories:

*   **Network Errors:**
    *   Examples: Connection timeouts, DNS resolution failures, unreachable hosts.
    *   Typically manifest as exceptions in the HTTP client library.
*   **Authentication/Authorization Errors (HTTP 401, 403):**
    *   `401 Unauthorized`: Missing, invalid, or expired API key/token.
    *   `403 Forbidden`: Valid authentication, but insufficient permissions for the requested resource or action.
*   **Rate Limit Errors (HTTP 429 Too Many Requests):**
    *   The application has exceeded the allowed number of requests in a given time window.
    *   APIs often include a `Retry-After` header indicating when to retry.
*   **Server-Side Errors from API Provider (HTTP 5xx):**
    *   `500 Internal Server Error`: A generic error on the API provider's end.
    *   `502 Bad Gateway`, `503 Service Unavailable`, `504 Gateway Timeout`: Indicate issues with the API provider's infrastructure.
*   **Validation Errors/Bad Requests (HTTP 400 Bad Request):**
    *   The request was malformed, contained invalid parameters, or failed schema validation.
    *   API responses often include details about the specific validation errors.
*   **Not Found Errors (HTTP 404 Not Found):**
    *   The requested resource does not exist.

## Standardized Internal Error Object/Structure

To handle errors consistently within the NEWEVENTS application, we will define a standardized internal error object. This object will be used to represent errors originating from API interactions, regardless of the specific API provider.

**Proposed Structure (TypeScript example):**

\`\`\`typescript
interface InternalApiError {
  statusCode: number; // HTTP status code from the API, or an internal code for network errors
  message: string; // A user-friendly message
  developerMessage?: string; // More detailed message for developers/logging
  errorCode?: string; // A specific error code from the API provider, if available
  originalError?: any; // The original error object from the HTTP client or API response
  timestamp: string; // When the error occurred
  path?: string; // The API endpoint that was called
  // Additional fields as needed
}
\`\`\`

## Mapping External API Errors to Internal Errors

A crucial step is to translate the diverse error responses from different APIs into our `InternalApiError` structure.

*   **Strategy:**
    *   Each API client implementation should include logic to catch errors and map them.
    *   Inspect the HTTP status code, response body, and headers of the external API error.
    *   Populate the fields of the `InternalApiError` object accordingly.
*   **Importance of Preserving Original Error Details:**
    *   Always store the original error object (or relevant parts of it) in the `originalError` field for comprehensive debugging.

## Logging Strategies for API Errors

Effective logging is essential for diagnosing and resolving API-related issues.

*   **What to Log:**
    *   **Timestamp:** When the error occurred.
    *   **API Endpoint:** The full URL that was called.
    *   **Request Details:** HTTP method, headers (sensitive information like API keys should be redacted or omitted from logs), and request body/parameters (again, redact sensitive data).
    *   **Response Details:** HTTP status code, response headers, and response body (if available and not excessively large).
    *   **InternalApiError Object:** The full standardized error object.
    *   **Stack Trace:** If the error resulted in an exception.
    *   **User Context:** If applicable, user ID or session ID to correlate errors with user activity.
*   **Log Levels:**
    *   Use appropriate log levels (e.g., `ERROR` for critical failures, `WARN` for retryable issues or non-critical failures).
*   **Tools and Services:**
    *   Utilize the project's standard logging library (e.g., Pino, Winston).
    *   Integrate with centralized logging platforms (e.g., Sentry, Logtail, Datadog) for better analysis and alerting.

## User-Facing Error Messages

When API errors impact the user, messages should be:

*   **Clear and Concise:** Avoid technical jargon. Explain the problem in simple terms.
*   **Helpful:** If possible, suggest what the user can do (e.g., "Please try again later," "Check your internet connection").
*   **Non-Alarming:** Present errors calmly.
*   **Consistent:** Use a uniform style and tone for error messages across the application.
*   **Localization:** Consider localization if the application supports multiple languages.
*   **Avoid Exposing Sensitive Details:** Never show raw API error responses or stack traces to the end-user.

## Retry Mechanisms and Backoff Strategies

For transient errors (e.g., network glitches, rate limits, temporary server issues), implementing retry logic can improve application resilience.

*   **Identifying Retryable Errors:**
    *   Typically, network errors and HTTP 429, 500, 502, 503, 504 status codes are candidates for retries.
    *   Non-retryable errors include 400, 401, 403, 404.
*   **Exponential Backoff with Jitter:**
    *   Instead of retrying immediately, wait for a progressively longer period between retries (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s).
    *   Add a small random delay (jitter) to the backoff time to prevent thundering herd problems where multiple clients retry simultaneously.
*   **Maximum Retry Attempts:**
    *   Set a reasonable limit on the number of retries (e.g., 3-5 attempts) to avoid indefinite retrying.
*   **`Retry-After` Header:**
    *   If an API returns a `Retry-After` header (common with 429 errors), respect this value.
*   **Circuit Breaker Pattern:**
    *   For critical APIs, consider implementing a circuit breaker pattern. If an API consistently fails, the circuit "opens," and requests to it are failed immediately for a period, preventing further load on a struggling service.

## Error Monitoring and Alerting

Proactive monitoring and alerting can help identify and address API issues quickly.

*   **Setup Alerts:** Configure alerts for:
    *   High rates of specific API errors (e.g., >X% of calls to an endpoint result in 5xx errors).
    *   Critical failures (e.g., authentication failures).
    *   Breaching of rate limits.
*   **Tools:** Utilize error tracking and Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools (e.g., Sentry, New Relic, Datadog) to monitor API health and error trends.

## Specific API Error Handling Notes

*   Refer to the individual API implementation guides in `API_Helper/<api_name>/` for any unique error codes or handling considerations specific to that API.
*   If an API has particularly complex or unusual error handling requirements, these should be documented in detail in its respective guide.

By adhering to these error handling patterns, NEWEVENTS can build more robust and reliable integrations with its third-party API dependencies.
