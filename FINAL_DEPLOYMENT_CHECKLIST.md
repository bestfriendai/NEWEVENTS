# Final Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Production Ready Status

### 1. **Supabase Integration**
- [x] Connected to production Supabase instance
- [x] All credentials in `.env.local`
- [x] Database schema verified
- [x] Edge Functions ready for API key retrieval

### 2. **Build & Quality**
- [x] Production build successful
- [x] ESLint passing (warnings only, no errors)
- [x] TypeScript compilation successful
- [x] Dependencies installed with `--legacy-peer-deps`

### 3. **Security**
- [x] CORS middleware configured
- [x] Security headers in production config
- [x] API keys stored securely in Supabase
- [x] Service role key for secure operations

### 4. **API Key Management**
- [x] Edge Function `get-api-keys` ready
- [x] Dynamic API key retrieval implemented
- [x] Fallback to environment variables if needed

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Install Vercel CLI (if not installed)
npm i -g vercel

# 2. Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# 3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
# - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
```

### Option 2: Other Platforms

```bash
# 1. Build the application
npm run build

# 2. Start production server
npm start
```

## üìã Post-Deployment Verification

1. **Test Supabase Connection**
   - Visit `/api/test-supabase`
   - Check console for connection status

2. **Verify API Keys**
   - Edge Function should fetch keys from Supabase
   - Check network tab for successful API calls

3. **Test Core Features**
   - [ ] User authentication (sign up/in/out)
   - [ ] Event search functionality
   - [ ] Favorites system
   - [ ] Map features (if Mapbox key present)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"exports is not defined" error**
   - This was fixed by simplifying the middleware
   - The current middleware only handles API routes

2. **API Keys Not Loading**
   - Ensure Edge Function is deployed: `supabase functions deploy get-api-keys`
   - Check Supabase secrets are set correctly

3. **Build Warnings**
   - Webpack cache warnings are non-critical
   - The app builds and runs successfully

## üìù Important Notes

- All sensitive API keys are stored in Supabase secrets
- The app works in "anonymous mode" without API keys
- Edge Functions handle secure key retrieval
- No API keys are exposed in the codebase

## üéâ Ready to Deploy!

Your app is fully configured and production-ready. Deploy with confidence!
