- **Data Quality:** ‚úÖ Good (events with tickets, venues, images)
- **Rate Limits:** ‚úÖ Within limits (X-RateLimit headers present)
- **Key Features Working:**
  - Real-time event search
  - Location-based filtering
  - Ticket link integration
  - Event images and thumbnails

#### 3. TomTom API ‚úÖ
- **Status:** Fully Operational
- **Connectivity:** ‚úÖ Success
- **Geocoding:** ‚úÖ Success (accurate location data)
- **Reverse Geocoding:** ‚úÖ Success (address resolution)
- **Performance:** ‚úÖ Fast (118ms query time)
- **Key Features Working:**
  - Address to coordinates conversion
  - Coordinates to address conversion
  - Location search with fuzzy matching
  - Detailed address components

#### 4. Supabase Database ‚úÖ
- **Status:** Fully Operational
- **Connectivity:** ‚úÖ Success (ejsllpjzxnbndrrfpjkz.supabase.co)
- **Authentication:** ‚úÖ Configured correctly
- **Environment:** ‚úÖ All required variables present
- **Key Features Working:**
  - Database connectivity
  - REST API access
  - Authentication system ready
  - Service role configuration

### üü° PARTIALLY WORKING

#### 5. Mapbox API ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Status:** Partially Operational
- **Connectivity:** ‚ùå Account endpoint failed (401 Unauthorized)
- **Geocoding:** ‚úÖ Success (accurate location data)
- **Reverse Geocoding:** ‚úÖ Success (place name resolution)
- **Issues:** Account verification endpoint requires different authentication. Server-side only.
- **Recommendation:** Core mapping functionality works; account endpoint not critical for event search. API key is server-side only.

#### 6. Eventbrite API ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Status:** Partially Operational
- **Connectivity:** ‚úÖ Success (authentication working)
- **Event Search:** ‚ùå Failed (404 Not Found on search endpoint)
- **Issues:** Search endpoint URL or parameters may be incorrect
- **Recommendation:** Review Eventbrite API documentation for correct search endpoint

### üî¥ NOT CONFIGURED

#### 7. PredictHQ API ‚ùå
- **Status:** Not Configured
- **Issue:** API key not provided in environment variables
- **Impact:** Missing event intelligence and prediction features
- **Recommendation:** Obtain PredictHQ API key if event predictions are required

## Event Search Functionality Test

### Main Events API Endpoint
- **URL:** `/api/events?location=New York&limit=3`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ FULLY WORKING (real data from Ticketmaster)
- **Response:** 15 real Broadway shows returned
- **Data Quality:** Excellent - complete event objects with all required fields
- **Source:** Ticketmaster API (live data)
- **Sample Events:** Hamilton, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child
- **‚úÖ FIXED:** Logger error resolved - no more fallback data needed

### Event Data Structure Validation ‚úÖ
All returned events include:
- ‚úÖ Unique ID
- ‚úÖ Title and description
- ‚úÖ Category classification
- ‚úÖ Date and time
- ‚úÖ Location and address
- ‚úÖ Pricing information
- ‚úÖ Organizer details
- ‚úÖ Attendee counts
- ‚úÖ Geographic coordinates
- ‚úÖ Event images

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Eventbrite Search Endpoint** ‚ö†Ô∏è IN PROGRESS
   - Authentication works (can get user info)
   - Search endpoint returns 404 - may require different permissions
   - Consider using user's events endpoint as alternative

2. **‚úÖ COMPLETED: Resolve Logger Error**
   - ‚úÖ Fixed `logger.time is not a function` error in events API
   - ‚úÖ Added missing `time()` and `measurePerformance()` functions
   - ‚úÖ Events API now returns real Ticketmaster data

### Optional Improvements

3. **Configure PredictHQ API**
   - Obtain API key if event intelligence features are needed
   - Implement event impact and attendance predictions

4. **Mapbox Account Endpoint**
   - Review authentication requirements for account endpoint
   - Consider if account verification is necessary for core functionality

### Environment Variables Status

#### ‚úÖ Properly Configured
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `TICKETMASTER_API_KEY`
- `RAPIDAPI_KEY`
- `RAPIDAPI_HOST`
- `TOMTOM_API_KEY`
- `EVENTBRITE_PRIVATE_TOKEN`

#### ‚ùå Missing
- `PREDICTHQ_API_KEY`
